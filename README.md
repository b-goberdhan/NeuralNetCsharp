# NeuralNetCsharp This library will have all the basic features in order to easily implement neural networks in C#.
So far this libary has basic Matrix definitions and Neural Network Functionility. You can teach the neural network (named NeuralMatrix class) for a given amount of iterations aswell as have the neural network learn in the background (using threading).
In future updates there will be:
-work on efficency and interconnecting neural networks.
-implement IO functionility in order to save configuation of neural network.
-implement network functionality in order to use a network in order to partition features of neural network (ie: dedicated server for "teaching" neural network.
-more rebust input layer and outout layer definition.
-"smart learning", predict when the neural network is having difficulty reaching the target value (ie: when too many hidden lyaers are used) and finding a better method to teach the network.

This is a very early build, documentation will come soon :)
